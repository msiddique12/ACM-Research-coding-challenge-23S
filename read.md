PROJECT OVERVIEW

I started the coding challenge by reading the Stars dataset into a dataframe using pandas in python. I then created a histogram visualization of the data. After that, I transformed the categorical
variables into numeric data. The final part of my project was training a logistic regression model on the star data to predict the star type.
