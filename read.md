<h2>PERSONAL OVERVIEW</h2>

<h4>I began this project with the intent to use knowledge I had gained about Machine Learning during last semester, but I ended up learning a lot of new things as well. With this project, I aimed to create a visualization of the data as well as train a Machine Learning model with the data. I was able to accomplish both of these things but I encountered a lot of struggles whilst attempting to preprocess the data before training the model. However, I was able to figure out what I was doing wrong and fix my errors. I was then pretty easily able to train the logistic regression model and dispplay its results.</h4>

<h1>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h1>

<h2>1. Reading the dataset into a dataframe</h2>
<h4>I used the pandas library to read the CSV file into a python dataframe. This allowed me to manipulate the data and use it effectively. </h4>
<h2>2. Data Visualization</h2>
<h4>Using the Matplotlib library, I created a frequency histogram of the data which displayed how much of each star type was in the dataset. This histogram showed me that there were 40 of each star type in the dataset.</h4>
<h2>3. Data Preprocessing</h2>
<h2>4. Training a multiclass logistic regression model</h2>
<h2>5. Accuracy and Heatmap of the model</h2>
